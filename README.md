# Exercise-Tracker using React
- I have used React class component to create this project. I have refer React documentation. We can create new Task to track our exercise. Initially task is in pending state so we can see it in pending tab. If we click on toggle button then it transfer to completed tab. We can see all tasks in View All tab. Also, we can edit and delete the task.
